/**
 * The adapter pattern
 *
 * This pattern is essentially what it sounds like. When an object is
 * not compatible with an implementation but are in the same context,
 * we can use adapters.
 *
 * Adapters are classes that wrap an object of an incompatible type,
 * and translate the equivalent methods to the implemented class.
